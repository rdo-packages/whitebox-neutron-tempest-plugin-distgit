I\u0027d say that adding them unnecessarily may cause issues at some point if, i.e. someone tries to build it in an env which is missing something as python3-coverage or python3-testtools.\n\nI\u0027d be more inclined to leave it as is, as we are not modifying runtime deps (which are correct) and we are building the package successfully, what shows that there are no real missing BuildRequires",
